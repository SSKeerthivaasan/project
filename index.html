    <h2>  my hobby is coding</h2>
    <p>i like coding new app and games. i like coding because coding is useful in ways.The code is compiled, which turns it into machine code the computer can understand. The computer executes the code, and writes Hello, world back to us. There are hundreds of different programming languages which can seem confusing, but they all do the same thing.Coding 101. If you don’t know the first thing about coding, you’ve come to the right place.
